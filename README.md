# OpenLearning
Still thinking of better options to package this idea 

My first try can be found in [old](https://github.com/allokkio/openLearning/tree/master/old)

For a long time I thought a [personal website](https://allokkio.github.io) would work better to lay out learning efforts and resoruces (see e.g.: [micro-reviews](https://allokkio.github.io/note/rnd-reviews/)). But, this is not the case. The minimal overhead and the direct editing-optionality on github makes lossely linked .md files superiorâ€“strangely enough.

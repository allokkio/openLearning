# GIT review

## Legacy 

This repository was previously labeled as "openLearning" because I wanted to share my self-directed learning efforts here. However, I am not learning in an ordered enough fashion to make that work, and am still thinking of better options to package this idea. Thus, from here on out, I will share some of my notes here. 

*Regarding the open learning idea*: My first try can be found in [old](https://github.com/allokkio/openLearning/tree/master/old). For a long time I thought a [personal website](https://allokkio.github.io) would work better to lay out learning efforts and resoruces. But, this is not the case. The minimal overhead and the direct editing-optionality on github makes lossely linked .md files superiorâ€“strangely enough.

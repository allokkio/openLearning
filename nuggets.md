# Nuggets
Amongst other things a nugget is a valuable idea or fact. Iâ€™d like to collect some, but for some reason they seem to be elusive. 

- **life.** The Ian knot seems to be the fastest way to tie shoes. [Here](https://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm) is a description from the inventor himself (also, please appreciate this website. It is gold).  
- **stats.** If we estimate the standard deviation of a normal distribution from an i.i.d. sample, then the estimated standard deviation is chi-squared distributed with n-1 degrees of freedom.
- **food.** Ciabatta was invented in [1982](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciabatta) (via [kottke](https://kottke.org)).
- **earth.** Hurricanes do [not cross the equator](https://www.iflscience.com/theres-a-weird-reason-why-hurricanes-never-cross-the-equator-68082) (via [kottke](https://kottke.org)).
- **earth/society**[Droughts might be a reason for todays popularity of skating](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/12/pgad395/7462603).

# Living dangerously 
## Preface
This section is inspired by *Gurstelle (2009): Absinthe & Flamethrowers: Projects and Ruminations on the Art of Living Dangerously*. The book gets it right at the expository chapter, but then goes on to provide [DIY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_it_yourself) instruction sheets for things that the author build. The most interesting part of the book made it into a [TED x talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YC8gY0ZiwLg). Don’t expect any insight beyond that from it. 

That said, the premise is a good one, however. Namely_ Calculated risk taking has many benefits (e.g., psychological) and leads to personal growth and a better, more enriched life. The emphasis here is also on the calculated risk. That is, „good risks" that are well-reasoned and thought through --- and not just reckless behavior. 

I believe that this premise is a good one. Let’s say you buy that argument (I do). What then? Gurstelle then does three things with it. First, he sketches out a loose framework for evaluating and balancing risk in everyday life. But, this framework is way too superficial--- Taleb’s 2019 book *„Antifragile: Things That Gain From Disorder“* does a much better job at it. Anyways, second, he provides several very superficial accounts of the history of „risky activities“ like drinking absinthe. I loved these section, but they are way to short and to view. Third, he shows off DYI projects that he did. These are the most boring part of the book, but also take the most space. 

I think that is a pitty, but thanks to the internet we can build up a list of resources that *should* have been in the book.

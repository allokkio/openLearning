# VIPs: Very Interesting Papers

In the following is a list of papers that I love. It’s a bit of a living document and I hope to eventually write a short motivation/comment for all of the papers. They deserve it. 

The papers are not selected for their importance or impact, but for how interesting they are to me. I exclude paper that I’ve been involved or where I have personal attachments to the authors. The order has no particular meaning. 

- [Klemeš (1986): Dilettantism in hydrology: Transition or destiny?](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/WR022i09Sp0177S?casa_token=KQ0xJR6iXFIAAAAA%3AxZrK4zMcg56qG4kAFphUBUolIuyluKxZB5esNm-LG0X3qB4vps6oSVM-JL39OtYKG1Z3X3jmM_0u4td1). More an essay than a scientific treatment. It essence, Klemeš lines out what kind of research hydrologist should do to avoid [scientism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism) and becoming more of a real science: Avoid sophistication without grounding, ask epistemic questions, focus on processes. The piece is certainly a product of its time (e.g., stochastic hydrology  does basically not exist anymore), but it is still a joy to read because Klemeš is super opinionated and writes very well. I look at it regularly and over time I came to disagree with quite some parts. 
- [Ha and Schidhuber (2018): World models](https://worldmodels.github.io). TBD
- [Zach Lypton (2016): The Mythos of Model Interpretability](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3236386.3241340). TBD
- [Robert Abrahart (2005): Neurohydrology: implementation options and a research agenda](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1475-4762.1999.tb00179.x). The paper that [schmidhubered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jürgen_Schmidhuber) our little [initiative](https://neuralhydrology.github.io). From todays point of view it is very interesting to see how many things Abrahart was able to conceptualize.

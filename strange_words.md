Words are strange and then there are strange words too! Where do they come from?


## Stationarity 
If the statistics of the joint distribution of the random variables does not change as a function of time we speak of stationarity.  

This definition seems to be first appear in [Khintchine (1934)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01449156). 
I reproduced the text-passage below for convenience reasons and it indeed is in accordance with the definition given above. Luckily German is my mother tongue.
It seems that [Kolmogorov (1938)](http://www.mathnet.ru/php/archive.phtml?wshow=paper&jrnid=rm&paperid=8953&option_lang=eng) follows the one given by 
Khintchine (1934), which reinforces the canoonical aspect of the definition, since well... it is Komogorov. Alas that reference is in Russian, so I cannot realy say if its the case.

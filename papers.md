### Paper Comments

- [Judd and Stemler (2010): Forecasting: it is not about statistics, it is about dynamics](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25663247). When reading one can see that authors had very specific model classes in mind. Still, I quite like their framing and the (historical) view they present regarding the forecasting problem. 
- [Judd and Nakamura (2006): Degeneracy of time series models: The best model is not always the correct model](https://doi.org/10.1063/1.2213957). A very interesting paper that demonstrates on basis of a simple example that when we model a non-linear system and noisy measruements the best model is likely not the correct (i.e. true) model. Given the few citation it has, I think that the insight of the paper and the clearness of the example is underapreciated.
